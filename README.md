The website is built using React framework.The values are fetched from CoinGecko API which is designed to function by providing real-time updates on cryptocurrency prices which is also used by crypto wallets like Trezor, MetaMask,etc. In future scope, automatic chart pattern recognition engine based on ML algorithms can be integrated with the website to assist people to trade efficiently. Premium APIs can be used for getting data at a higher rate.
